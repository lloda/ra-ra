#+STARTUP: logdone

* TODO Everything [0/4]
  - [ ] Features [0/2]
    - [ ] Should be able to reshape iota (??) or show examples with TensorIndex, maybe. One idea is
      to generalize View (so View<Iota>, etc.) which is something that newra does.
    - [0/5] Fix relationship between WithStorage and View
      - [ ] forward const/nonconst overloads to View or ViewConst from here.
      - [ ] remove inheritance relationship of WithStorage on View
      - [ ] add const/nonconst casts of WithStorage to View or ViewConst
      - [ ] remove const overloads from View::operator()
      - [ ] make View be View<pointer> and not View<value_type>
    - [ ] gemv(conj(a), b) should work. Beat View-like selectors down an Expr??
  - [ ] Debug, error report [0/2]
    - [ ] Runtime error check facility, cf. test/test-check-runtime.C
    - [ ] Static check on Small constructors e.g. real3 {1, 2, 3}. Cf big.H:513 init<SS>(SS const & s).
  - [-] Building [3/4]
    - [X] Build doc with cmake
    - [X] Support RA_USE_BLAS with cmake (linux)
    - [X] Support RA_USE_BLAS with cmake (mac) <2018-12-07 Fri 16:33>
    - [ ] Make cmake tests respect dependences and able to be run independently.
  - [ ] Documentation [0/2]
    - [ ] Complete section on internals
    - [ ] Complete section on other languages, libraries
