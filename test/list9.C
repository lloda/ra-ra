    When a list constructor stores the begin pointer from the initializer_list
    argument, this doesnâ€™t extend the lifetime of the array, so if a class variable
    is constructed from a temporary initializer_list, the pointer is left dangling
    by the end of the variable declaration statement.

<lloda> I don't understand this warning in 9.1                          [13:06]
<lloda> https://wandbox.org/permlink/RTIL3P6nRanIx4Sd
<lloda> I've read
<lloda>
        https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-9.1.0/gcc/C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options.html#index-Winit-list-lifetime
<lloda> the last item
<lloda> but doesn't it make a difference that I use p(a.begin()) and not
        p(x.begin()) ?
<lloda> either gives the same warning
<redi> no, it makes no difference                                       [13:07]
<redi> a and x are both just pointers to the same underlying array
<redi> the array is not owned by the initializer_list
<redi> do not store an initializer_list like that. ever. it's not a container.
<lloda> fair :O                                                         [13:08]
<lloda> then the { p = a.begin(); } should warn as well?
<redi> it's for INITIALIZING, not storing data
<redi> yes, ideally that would warn too
<redi> your comment says "works" but it's wrong. It doesn't work any
       differently, it just doesn't warn.                               [13:09]
